Prod
=========

Prod is a productivity tracker for Windows.

Prod periodically looks at the window currently in the foreground 
and detects user input to decide what program the user is currently 
interacting with. After enough data has accumulated, the user can 
view a chart of a per-category breakdown of time usage.

### Configurable

The user can modify the provided json config file to create associations
between programs and productivity categories.

### Time estimation

Prod uses a percent based time keeping system so that it is easier to 
tell at a glance how much of a day has gone by.

To see wall clock time, the user can simply mouse over the widget.

### Browser support.

Prod can scrape the url from Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer, 
giving the user more fine-grained control productivity tracking.

### Notes

This is just a little thing I threw together so I could keep track of
how I was spending my time without having to resort to paid solutions.
However if decide to try it and encounter any issues, please let me know!
